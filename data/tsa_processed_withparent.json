Proxies are artificial embeddings that can be learned in the training process and are designed to represent data. In supervised settings, there are as many proxies as the number of classes, so each class is well approximated by one artificial proxy. The loss is calculated based on possible triples formed from observations representing the anchor class, a positive proxy (a proxy from the anchor class) and a negative proxy (a proxy from a class different from the anchor). The advantage of the proxy-based method over previous approaches is that the number of all possible triples grows linearly to the cardinality of the dataset, whereas it grows cubically in the case of non-proxy-based loss. In addition, the proxies are more robust to outliers and thus have better performance in terms of speed and convergence.

The compression is obtained at 95% of the input image and saved, which is later evaluated with the original image for differences.

We focus on a brief introduction of representation learning for nodes in supervised or semi-supervised classification tasks. Most existing approaches follow a message-passing framework and use a permutation-invariant local aggregation scheme to update each node's representation, e.g., spatial GNNs. For example, GCN\u00a0[31] averages features of each node's neighbors, including the node's self feature, to update its representation. GAT\u00a0[49] introduces an attention mechanism to learn aggregation weights over all neighbors. For fast and scalable GNN training, sampling-based methods have been developed, such as GraphSAGE\u00a0[28] and FastGCN\u00a0[7]. The simplifying approaches\u00a0[51], [46], [59] also make the GNN methods more efficient.\n", "annotation": {"entities": {"a1": {"id": "a1", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#7a5a0ca4-a527-4f6c-b6c0-f452ec5c0ae9", "surface_form": "GNNs", "start": 0, "end": 4}, {"id": "#92e9b347-08be-4c11-8b94-c9bf9048c545", "surface_form": "GNNs", "start": 336, "end": 340}, {"id": "#8f493ccb-4c0d-4ff8-ac2e-7dd4cd35d1b8", "surface_form": "GNN", "start": 587, "end": 590}, {"id": "#32eb6aa6-44bf-4cc6-b096-73375a876c48", "surface_form": "GNN", "start": 743, "end": 746}]}, "a9": {"id": "a9", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#98552386-72be-4988-8917-282832c41dc3", "surface_form": "GCN", "start": 355, "end": 358}]}, "a10": {"id": "a10", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#490d9ab8-2ff1-4ee4-8688-de23f42e32a0", "surface_form": "GAT", "start": 473, "end": 476}]}, "a11": {"id": "a11", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#57c2b73d-6932-4e42-97fd-5ceafb14b080", "surface_form": "attention mechanism", "start": 496, "end": 515}]}, "a12": {"id": "a12", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#13df3c2b-e9a2-4d69-b246-d261d14f65c1", "surface_form": "GraphSAGE", "start": 653, "end": 662}]}, "a13": {"id": "a13", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#568fbd43-7ad9-461a-a4ca-c608ea95857e", "surface_form": "FastGCN", "start": 672, "end": 679}]}}, "relations": {}}, "annotation_raw": null}, {"annotator_id": "tsa", "document_id": "2211.14208", "paragraph_index": 9, "text": "Recently, Balcilar et al.\u00a0[1] bridge the gap between spectral and spatial GNNs and unify them into a single framework.

The publishing industry has been digitized in general and academic publishing is no exception. It has become much more easier for knowledge to propagate when stored at a digital platform.

Apart from official publications, digital repositories for e-prints, like arXiv\u00a0[19], also register an upward movement in submissions, with 77.1% submissions of computer science on arXiv becoming peer-reviewed publications eventually\u00a0[35]. The rapid increase in the amount of published information creates enormous difficulties for researchers to manage data available to them, and thus causes the problem of information overload\u00a0[21], [49]. For any researcher, time and energy are limited resources that need to be managed efficiently. At the same time, keeping up to date with newly published research in a certain field is crucial as it prevents one's work from being repetitive or derivative. With the sheer number of online services and platforms available to researchers, it becomes unprecedentedly difficult to do a thorough literature search among the overloaded academic data. Worse still, academic information overload also causes inappropriate citation practices.

Each candidate source paper of an entity is given a cooccurrence count (see Fig.\u00a0REF ). This cooccurrence count indicates how many times a paper is presented as an in-text citation in the same sentence with this entity in S2ORC. It is a strong quantitative index of the correlation between an entity and a paper. The higher the cooccurrence count, the stronger the correlation between the entity and the candidate source paper, i.e. higher possibility for this paper to be the entity's source paper. On the basis of this positive correlation, a cooccurrence count-based score is computed to be the first sorting criterion. This scoring makes full use of the citation behavior of researchers, looking into what is most-cited when the researchers mention this entity. The formulation of the cooccurrence count score of the \\(l\\) -th paper \\(r_{count_{l}}\\)  in the mapped candidate source paper set of a published entity \\(e\\)  is as follows:\n\\(r_{count_{l}} = w_{count_{l}} = \\frac{n_l}{SC}\\) \n\\(SC = \\sum _{l=1}^{L} n_l\\) \nwhere \\(n_l\\)  is the cooccurrence count of a candidate source paper \\(c_l\\)  for \\(e\\)  and \\(L\\)  is the total number of candidate source papers of \\(e\\) . \\(SC\\)  is the sum of cooccurrence counts that \\(e\\)  has with all the candidate source papers.\n\nWeighted context embedding-based sorting criterion\nThe first method makes use of the positive correlation of cooccurrence between an entity and its candidate source papers, but it does not take into consideration what the entity is and in which context it is mentioned. It can sort out the candidate source papers in order correctly for the majority of published entities, but not for polysemous entities, i.e. entities that have a name with more than one meaning. SAFD is one example. It can mean Stirring As Foam Disruption\u00a0[27], Statistical Adaptive Fourier Decomposition\u00a0[54] or Single Shot Anchor Free Face Detector\u00a0[60]. It relies largely on the context in which the entity is used to decide its contextual meaning and recommend its source paper. To address the problem of polysemy, we use context embedding to find out the contextual correlation between an entity and its candidate source papers. The computation is shown as follows:\n\\(w_{context_{l}} = CosSim(SciBERT(s),SciBERT(t_l))\\) \nwhere \\(SciBERT\\)  denotes the method of generating embedding using SciBERT\u00a0[3]. \\(s\\)  is the sentence in which the published entity \\(e\\)  is located. \\(t_l\\)  is the text that concatenates the title and abstract of the \\(l\\) -th candidate source paper of \\(e\\)  in its candidate source paper set. \\(CosSim\\)  denotes the calculation of cosine similarity. Then the weighted context embedding score of the \\(l\\) -th candidate source paper \\(r_{mix_{l}}\\)  can be calculated as the formulation below:\n\\(r_{mix_{l}} = \\lambda w_{count_{l}}+(1-\\lambda )w_{context_{l}}\\) \nTo improve the performance of this criterion, the hyperparameter \\(\\lambda \\)  is applied.\n\n", "annotation": {"entities": {"a20": {"id": "a20", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#ceeb90e6-d7de-4482-80f4-b5a05d80edca", "surface_form": "S2ORC", "start": 311, "end": 316}]}, "a23": {"id": "a23", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#28b2506e-feac-4d67-b9fc-c481a4fff753", "surface_form": "Statistical Adaptive Fourier Decomposition", "start": 1899, "end": 1941}]}, "a24": {"id": "a24", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#933024c3-0992-4e00-a1ea-b3dafc5cfe3e", "surface_form": "Single Shot Anchor Free Face Detector", "start": 1950, "end": 1987}]}, "a5": {"id": "a5", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#0721ffd6-5e30-4907-a09f-cc2a1b23e5b0", "surface_form": "SciBERT", "start": 2431, "end": 2438}]}}, "relations": {}}, "annotation_raw": null}, {"annotator_id": "tsa", "document_id": "2210.10073", "paragraph_index": 28, "text": "The pipeline of CRPSE is as follows.

In computer vision, the application of neural networks gains popularity in object recognition earlier (around 2010) than the other two more complex tasks of object detection and image segmentation (hardest and also the latest).\n", "annotation": {"entities": {}, "relations": {}}, "annotation_raw": null}, {"annotator_id": "tsa", "document_id": "1808.09602", "paragraph_index": 134, "text": "Figure\u00a0REF  shows the human evaluation of the constructed knowledge graph, comparing the quality of automatically generated knowledge graphs with and without the coreference links.\nWe randomly select 10 frequent scientific entities and extract all the relation triples that include one of the selected entities leading to 1.5k relation triples from both systems.

GREAD-AC marks the best accuracy on Cornell and third place in Film and Chameleon.\n{TABLE}{TABLE}{FIGURE}{FIGURE}", "annotation": {"entities": {"a4": {"id": "a4", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#b48c816d-59d5-4a46-912b-4ae83af8e228", "surface_form": "method", "start": 79, "end": 85}, {"id": "#97347e27-3a3b-4b08-a2ef-d8a0a9ad66cf", "surface_form": "GREAD", "start": 285, "end": 290}, {"id": "#38f27f06-3d22-4442-bd73-f172314e3e31", "surface_form": "GREAD", "start": 470, "end": 475}, {"id": "#22188314-b255-468f-b2d8-30ee7d82a5cb", "surface_form": "GREAD", "start": 507, "end": 512}, {"id": "#1e8dddc3-dc10-46cd-8943-001a7c000902", "surface_form": "GREAD", "start": 582, "end": 587}]}, "a41": {"id": "a41", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#e863bd22-063b-4a46-ada7-6a28c56d0f3e", "surface_form": "Squirrel", "start": 134, "end": 142}]}, "a47": {"id": "a47", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#a21af0c2-e00f-4e0d-97b9-9722098b6379", "surface_form": "Citeseer", "start": 147, "end": 155}]}, "a54": {"id": "a54", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#46021e01-5af7-43c1-8583-dfd9d781a6b6", "surface_form": "GCNII", "start": 157, "end": 162}, {"id": "#41bddd7f-135c-4343-a71e-dd012ca32ef3", "surface_form": "GCNII", "start": 308, "end": 313}]}, "a51": {"id": "a51", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#6826404a-26cb-46f3-aefe-6809c4e9d746", "surface_form": "H2GCN", "start": 167, "end": 172}]}, "a8": {"id": "a8", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#77d9faff-11af-495b-8af6-530da7d39281", "surface_form": "BS", "start": 291, "end": 293}, {"id": "#c366840c-620a-4b3a-9ee6-6a43bef3fb5b", "surface_form": "BS", "start": 476, "end": 478}]}, "a21": {"id": "a21", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#01f4e503-09cd-42b9-b600-c1b275a481ce", "surface_form": "BLEND", "start": 396, "end": 401}]}, "a5": {"id": "a5", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#d603ecdb-019d-4172-b3f7-0aac89889614", "surface_form": "F", "start": 513, "end": 514}]}, "a43": {"id": "a43", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#0fbd9e84-4e32-4497-b1b2-3f596dc36e12", "surface_form": "Texas", "start": 538, "end": 543}]}, "a40": {"id": "a40", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#5da726bd-ea4c-4331-9593-06392432c82b", "surface_form": "Chameleon", "start": 571, "end": 580}, {"id": "#a28bb6d4-1654-4d3b-8a63-33cd16527a72", "surface_form": "Chameleon", "start": 654, "end": 663}]}, "a6": {"id": "a6", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#b2a7d3b8-8501-4f6e-97a5-07adb32210c1", "surface_form": "AC", "start": 588, "end": 590}]}, "a45": {"id": "a45", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#2968b732-46c7-47f0-9a32-ca71321abee5", "surface_form": "Cornell", "start": 618, "end": 625}]}, "a42": {"id": "a42", "type": "a", "subtype": null, "surface_forms": [{"id": "#e3ce8501-1d65-416f-a44c-1f894f894414", "surface_form": "Film", "start": 645, "end": 649}]}}, "relations": {}}, "annotation_raw": null}, {"annotator_id": "tsa", "document_id": "2211.14208", "paragraph_index": 57, "text": "The oversmoothing phenomenon means that as the depth increase, all node features converge to a constant.

K-means is a fine example. This famous algorithm is presented by [38] in 1967. Later, k-means become one of the basic knowledge that every researcher in the field of machine learning knows it. They use this algorithm to process data or develop new methods. But as it becomes overly popular, some researchers use it without citation. Datasets are also in the same situation. Over one-fourth of the published entities without citations are found to be datasets. Datasets are applied to test the performance of models and algorithms. Some datasets are used extensively and gradually become gold standards for certain tasks.

With analysis on open access papers from prestigious computer science conferences in 2020, we find that missing citations of published scientific entities are quite common, even for papers published in top computer science conferences.
