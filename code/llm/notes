* requiring completion to contain entity name and type
  (instead of just the entity) prevented output of only a list
  of all entity types present in text
* in YAML output, requiring a “has_x” before a list of the
  x’s prevents “forced output”
* end to end also promising
    * worked well on positive case
    * worked well on entities but no params/vals case
    * on nothing cases was mixed -> TODO: re-try with prompt chain
