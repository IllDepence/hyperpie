* entity scope
    * requiring completion to contain entity name and type
      (instead of just the entity) prevented output of only a list
      of all entity types present in text
    * in end2end (non-chain) setting, putting entity types in brackets
      in YAML *and* requiring output of entity type did non prevent
      “input embeddings” being predicted as an entity (type model)
* in YAML output
    * requiring a “has_x” before a list of the x’s prevents “forced output”
    * adding “/null” to value and context for parameters prevents “forced output”
      of contexts
* end to end also promising
    * worked well on positive case
    * worked well on entities but no params/vals case
    * on nothing cases was mixed -> TODO: re-try with prompt chain
* surface forms
    * LaTeX can get parsed (in input text: “\(\lambda _{ext{C}}=0.3\)” but in
      output “name: λ_ext{C}, value: 0.3”)


TODOs:
    - script for annotated paragraph to YAML output (LLM prompt example)
    - script for parsing LLM YAML output
    - script for evaluation
