The base document representation of our model is formed by SciBERT-base [4] and BiLSTM with 128-d hidden state. We use a dropout of 0.2 after BiLSTM embeddings. All feedforward networks are composed of two hidden layers, each of dimension 128 with gelu activation and with a dropout of 0.2 between layers. For additive attention layer in span representation, we collapse the token embeddings to scalars by passing through the feedforward layer with 128-d hidden state and performing a softmax. We train our model for 30 epochs using Adam optimizer with 1e-3 as learning rate for all non BERT weights and 2e-5 for BERT weights. We use early stopping with a patience value of 7 on the validation set using relation extraction F1 score. All our models were trained using 48Gb Quadro RTX 8000 GPUs. The multitask model takes approximately 3\n[Input Text end]\n\nAnswer in the following YAML format.\n\nFormat:\n---\n- entity\n- entity\n- etc.\n...\n\nOnly produce output in the YAML format specified above.
