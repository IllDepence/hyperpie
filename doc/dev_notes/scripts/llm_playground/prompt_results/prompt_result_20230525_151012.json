What (if any) are their parameters and values?\n\n[LaTeX Input Text start]\nIn this paper, we investigate if preprints are affected by citation bias concerning the author affiliation. We focus on the author affiliation, as a survey by Soderberg et al. [32] observed that 35% of respondents consider the author's institution as extremely or very important to assess the credibility of preprints. Therefore, we assume that author affiliation has an influence on the citation counts of preprints. We verify the existence of citation bias by computing citation inequality. To this end, we measure to which degree the number of citations that preprints and their publisher versions receive is unequally distributed. Specifically, we measure citation bias with regard to author affiliation on the institution level and country level. Comparing differences in the citation inequality between preprints and their respective publisher versions allows us to mitigate the effects of confounding factors and see whether or not citation biases related to author affiliation have an increased effect on preprint citations. Conclusions drawn from this type of investigation are based on the assumption that the process of peer-review and formal publication is generally perceived as an assurance of quality [25] and therefore \u201clevels the playing field\u201d among articles in terms of citability. \n[LaTeX Input Text end]\n\nAnswer in the following YAML format.\n\nFormat:\n---\n- text_contains_entities: true/false\n- entities (datasets, models, methods, loss functions, regularization techniques):\n    - entity<N>:\n        name: <entity name>\n        type: <entity type>\n        has_parameters: true/false\n        parameters:\n            - parameter<N>:\n                name: <parameter name>\n                value: <parameter value>/null\n                context: <value context>/null\n...\n\nOnly produce output in the YAML format specified above.
