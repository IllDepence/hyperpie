In the context of machine learning and related fields, what (if any) are the entities (datasets, models, methods, loss functions, regularization techniques) mentioned in the LaTeX Input Text below? What (if any) are their parameters and values?

[LaTeX Input Text start]
Our system extends the implementation and hyper-parameters from Lee2017EndtoendNC with the following adjustments. We use a 1 layer BiLSTM with 200-dimensional hidden layers. All the FFNNs have 2 hidden layers of 150 dimensions each. We use 0.4 variational dropout [15] for the LSTMs, 0.4 dropout for the FFNNs, and 0.5 dropout for the input embeddings. We model spans up to 8 words. For beam pruning, we use \(\lambda _{\text{C}}=0.3\) for coreference resolution and \(\lambda _{\text{R}}=0.4\) for relation extraction. For constructing the knowledge graph

Answer in the following YAML format.

Format:
---
- text_contains_entities: true/false
- entities (datasets, models, methods, loss functions, regularization techniques):
    - entity<N>:
        name: <entity name>
        type: <entity type>
        has_parameters: true/false
        parameters:
            - parameter<N>:
                name: <parameter name>
                value: <parameter value>/null
                context: <value context>/null
...

Only produce output in the YAML format specified above. Output no additional text.

Output:
```
