* expected model output
    * only cases, in which we have at least
        * artifact
        * parameter (of the artifact)
        * value (of the parameter)
    * contexts are optional
* evaluation (exact/partial matches of entity spans)
    * additional idea:
        * for each known entity, define a list of surface forms that are regarded as valid
            * example: ground truth "Adam optimizer", prediction "Adam" → correct, but prediction "optimizer" → incorrect
    * open question: what to do with artifact, parameter, value triples that are “partically correct”
        * example: [Adam]　← [α] ← [15]
