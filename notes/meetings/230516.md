# Methodology

### What I have done 

* Joint extraction model 
    * SemEval-2022 data
* two stage model
    * spaCy 3 (previous work)
* distant supervision model
    * dti data


* Additional training data from un-annotated papers (~200k)
    * Based on rules (@xiao-nx: please add links)


* research artifact: `a`
* parameter: `p`
* value
    * number: `vn`
    * set: `vs`
    * range: `vr`
    * other: `vo`
* context: `c`

* Relations (Maybe Rules):
[research artifact, parameter]
[parameter, value]
[value, context]




### Questions

    * /opt/hyperparam_extraction/

* How to use our GitLab?
