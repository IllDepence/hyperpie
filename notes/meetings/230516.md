# Methodology

### What I have done 

* Joint extraction model 
    * SemEval-2022 data
* two stage model
    * spaCy 3 (previous work)
* distant supervision model
    * dti data


* Additional training data from un-annotated papers (~200k)
    * Based on rules (@xiao-nx: please add links)


* current state
    * Tarek
        * annotation guidelines finalized
        * 7 papers (~370 paragraphs) annotated
        * student data checked (maybe not usable)
    * Xiao
        * 3 models working on custom data
            * Nicholas' model
            * spaCy 3 model
            * distant supervision model
* goal for meeting next week
    * models have been applied to own data
    * error classes identified

* research artifact: `a`
* parameter: `p`
* value
    * number: `vn`
    * set: `vs`
    * range: `vr`
    * other: `vo`
