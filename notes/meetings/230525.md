* Paper Structure
    * Motivation(s)
        * extract hyperparameter information for cs papers
        * Once we got accuracy hyperparameter information, we can xxx...
    * Workflow:
        * 1. SOTA methods on related work
        * 2. run SOTA methods on our data
        * 3. find the weakness of SOTA methods on our data
        * 4. improve the method(s)
        * 5. run the proposed method on related work data
    * Method
        * Baseline code/model
        * LLM
        * Just baby ideas:
            * LLM vs distant supervision --> test on annotation data
            * LLM generated data --> feed to exsiting method as train data

* Timeline
    * May:
        * experiments: (3 + 1 models)
            * joint relation extraction model
            * two-stage entity-relation extraction model
            * distant supervision model
            * LLM model    
    * June:
        * June 02: first results.
            * model/results/error(s) analyse
        * June 16: improve
            * model/results/error(s) analyse
    * July
        * summary & write paper
